In this presentation, we will look at Jamestown's reporting system, which lets developers use a simple Groovy DSL to deploy CSV file generators and Jasper Reports to our end users.  The (Grails) server presents the parameter form to the users and delivers the output of the report.  The DSL supports parameters with lists of values and defaults.  It displays data from dynamic SQL queries, arbitrary Groovy closures, or even plain SQL files.  An extra benefit is that our reports are all in plain text formats, so it is easy to track them with version control.
