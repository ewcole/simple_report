In this presentation, we will look at Jamestown's Grails-based report server, which provides a simple Groovy DSL to deploy CSV file generators and Jasper Reports to end users.  The server presents a parameter form to the users and delivers the output of the report, which can get its data from dynamic SQL queries, arbitrary Groovy closures, or even plain SQL files.  An extra benefit is that the reports are all in plain text formats, so it is easy to track them with version control or search them from the command line.  An additional extra benefit is that there are no expensive licenses to purchase, since it is built entirely with Java and open-source tools.
